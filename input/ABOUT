This directory should contain all datasets (in some organization) 
used in this repository. Unique data sets (one's I've made) will 
likely get saved here, but most are available elsewhere. Since saving 
this all to the repo would be silly and redundant, I'll document what and where
I got them from in this file:

And eventually I write a script to just pull all / some of these for
you with a few lines
