First attempt at implementing ML models on 'real' data. Tried to hack together
a reasonable answer in a couple hours (which is why the coding is really ugly).
Have a few thoughts going forward on how to clean this up for this paricular model
and other models in general, particularly when doing something where we generate
a model to infer missing data (e.g. making classes to handle making sure all the 
data is cleaned appropriately and assiging sub-models (right term?) as attributes
of that class). ALSO learned very quickly that the 'hard' part isn't
really training the model. Its making sure the data is cleaned and prepared properly 
(even for when its mostly already pretty 'nice' like in this dataset).
Clearly worthwhile spending more time learning significance of individual features
and obvious correlations before blindly hitting things with a hammer.

I'm planning on iterating on this a bit more, but I may decide to just stop here
and sink more time into a different project with a less popular dataset. Doing 
something else may be more worthwhile (i.e. more easily provable that I actually did
some work and didn't just copy-paste from a blog)
